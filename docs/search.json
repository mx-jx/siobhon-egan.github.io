The frequently used General Time Reversible (GTR) family of nested models encompasses 64 models with different combinations of parameters for DNA site substitution. The models are listed here from the least complex to the most parameter rich.\nSome common programs to carry out phylogenetic analysis include:\n\nMrBayes\nPAUP*\nBEAST v2\nPhyML v3\nPAML\nRAxML\nIQ-TREE\n\nThe below also include the settings if the model is available in these programs.

It is also commonly the default model in many programs.\n\nMrBayes nst=2\nPAUP abaaba\nPAML abbbba\nBEAST\nPhyML\nIQ-TREE\n\nTamura-Nei (TrN/TN93) variable base frequencies, equal transversion rates, variable transition rates (Tamura Nei 1993)\n\nMrBayes\nPAUP abaaea\nPAML abbbbf\nBEAST\nPhyML\nIQ-TREE\n\nKimura 3-parameter (K3P) variable base frequencies, equal transition rates, two transversion rates (Kimura 1981)\n\nMrBayes\nPAUP (abccba)\nPAML (abccba)\nBEAST\nPhyML\nIQ-TREE\n\nTransition model (TIM) variable base frequencies, variable transition rates, two transversion rates\n\nMrBayes\nPAUP abccea\nPAML abccbe\nBEAST\nRAxML (check)\nPhyML\nIQ-TREE\n\nTransversion model (TVM) variable base frequencies, variable transversion rates, transition rates equal\n\nMrBayes\nPAUP (abcdbe)\nPAML (abcdea)\nBEAST\nPhyML\nIQ-TREE\n\nSymmetrical model (SYM) equal base frequencies, symmetrical substitution matrix (A to T = T to A) (Zharkikh 1994)\n\nMrBayes nst=6\nPAUP abcdef\nPAML abcdef\nBEAST\nPhyML\nIQ-TREE\n\ngeneral time reversible (GTR) variable base frequencies, symmetrical substitution matrix (e.g., Lanave et al.¬†1984, Tavare 1986, Rodriguez et. al.¬†1990)\n\nMrBayes nst=6\nPAUP abcdef\nPAML abcdef\nBEAST\nPhyML\nIQ-TREE\n\n\nRate variation\nIn addition to models describing the rates of change from one nucleotide to another, there are models to describe rate variation among sites in a sequence. The following are the two most commonly used models and are generally available across all platforms and programs.\ngamma distribution (G) gamma distributed rate variation among sites\nproportion of invariable sites (I)* extent of static, unchanging sites in a dataset\n\n\n\nPrograms\nSome well resourced programs to carry out model selection include:\n\nMEGA\nPhyML\njmodeltest\nModelFinder which is implemented in IQ-TREE\n\nDepending on the program most will produce two sets of ‚Äòscores‚Äô to assess the models. the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The lower the score the more support there is for a particular model. There are different reasons for choosing the best model based on the AIC or BIC scores. Generally the BIC score is used in most cases, however if in doubt its always best to do some more research to understand why you chose that value. Some references for more information on these criterion available here Luo A. et al. 2010; Sullivan J. and Joyce P. 2005,Brewer M. J. et al. 2016.\nExample output from MEGA7 using Model Selection feature"

Start here for official Zotero information. Some useful library guides available from Melbourne Uni, Monash and Harvard.\nZotero is free, however your cloud storage comes with 300MB of storage. You can integrate it with your own preferred cloud storage (e.g.¬†dropbox, google drive etc) or you can pay to upgrade. Going over the 300MB limit won‚Äôt affect you adding in citations it just means that any attachments will not be saved on your cloud account, however you could still just storage them locally fine.\nHere is a presentation I gave on getting started in Zotero - link\n\n\n\nWebsite FREE\n\n\n\nWebsite $$ EndNote is probably one of the most commonly used referencing programs. It is a paid program, however most universities make it available for staff and students for free. However when you loss your institution log in details you will need to start your referencing again. This is one of the biggest reasons I advocate againist using EndNote. In addition the program is very large and is known for crashing computers, especially if you do not keep your version current. With that all said there is a wealth of information available on how to use EndNote, here to get you started."

But not only that, they will help shape the type of researcher you become, so it‚Äôs important to choose carefully. Your supervisor‚Äôs role is to give you feedback on your work, provide support and guidance, and help you stay on track.\nThe best advice I can give to PhD students is that you are the manager of your project. Your supervisors are like the big boss. They‚Äôll help you source the funds and find the tools to do the project, but you need to tell them what you need. It is a skill in itself and takes some time to learn (I am still learning), but it‚Äôs important to treat it as such as work on your supervisor-relationship.\nSome helpful resources on supervisor relationship at Monash University site\nSupervisors\nSome useful resources and forms are available at iThinkwell.

If you are an undergraduate or post graduate research student it is likely that you will have to organise your own data storage/back up system. Universities will give staff (and sometimes post-graduates) access to a server where you can store your data on, however even then you may still like to have your own back up of things.\nI strongly advise against relying solely on hard-drives. Altough these can be an enticing offer with their one-off payment and physical nature in my experience they are unreliable, not good for transport and you can run into issues with file types & different systems.\nI recommend a cloud based storage system - ideally two if you can!\nUsually they come with a monthly fee where you can pick the plan that suits your needs and upgrade/down easily when your storage needs change.\nMy recommendation is to pick a cloud based system you don‚Äôt have to think too much about. It maybe tempting to find an obsecure third party system for your computer but if you have to constantly manage it will become a hassel."

    "text": "Maximum likelihood\n\nQuick tutorial on using IQ-TREE webserver\nIQ-TREE is available as a downloadable program and as an online interface (via web servers).\nIt is a powerful program that is built for speed! Maximum likelihood methods can consume a lot of compute power, the web interface can do robust analysis in just minutes.\nIt has some fantastic documentation with detailed tutorials - see here. Current manual available here.\nSome key features of IQ-TREE are:\n\nEfficient search algorithm: Fast and effective stochastic algorithm to reconstruct phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood.\nUltrafast bootstrap: An ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) to assess branch supports. UFBoot is 10 to 40 times faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap and obtains less biased support values.\nUltrafast model selection: An ultrafast and automatic model selection (ModelFinder) which is 10 to 100 times faster than jModelTest and ProtTest. ModelFinder also finds best-fit partitioning scheme like PartitionFinder.\nPhylogenetic testing: Several fast branch tests like SH-aLRT and aBayes test (Anisimova et al., 2011) and tree topology tests like the approximately unbiased (AU) test (Shimodaira, 2002).\n\nThe strength of IQ-TREE is the availability of a wide variety of phylogenetic models:\n\nCommon models: All common substitution models for DNA, protein, codon, binary and morphological data with rate heterogeneity among sites and ascertainment bias correction for e.g.¬†SNP data.\nPartition models: Allowing individual models for different genomic loci (e.g.¬†genes or codon positions), mixed data types, mixed rate heterogeneity types, linked or unlinked branch lengths between partitions.\nMixture Models: fully customizable mixture models and empirical protein mixture models and.\nPolymorphism-aware models (PoMo): http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Polymorphism-Aware-Models\n\nPersonally I like to use the web interface, it saves one less program taking up memory on your computer and is super quick!\nI like to use the CIBID, Austria.\nReference for command line options are available here\n\n\n\nIQ-TREE webserver interface\n\n\n\n\nYour alignment file can be .fasta., .phylip, .nexus.\nSelect the Sequence type (you can keep it as Auto-detect if you like, but this will save any issues incase it does not recognise your data correctly).\nLeave the Partion file blank\n\n\n\nDetails on subtitution models available here\nIf you have not already chosen your model, under Substitution model leave it as Auto and it will perform model selection for you.\nI generally leave the FreeRate heterogeneity and Ascertainment bias correction options unchecked.\n\n\n\nBootstrap analysis select Ultrafast. This will perform bootstrap approximation using the UFBoot method Minh et al.¬†2013.\nCheck the box next to Create .ufboot file and select 10,000 for Maximum iterations. I leave Minimum correlation coefficient as 0.99 and SH-aLRT branch test as Yes with 1000 # replicates. Select the check box next to Approximate Bayes test\n\n\n\nI leave the Perturbation strength as 0.5 and IQ-TREE stopping rule as 100. Approximate Bayes test or 0.5\nEnter your email and SUBMIT JOB\n\n\n\nEither click on the Analysis tab long the top or follow the link in the email and you will find your results. I find this server is super quick, usually seconds/minutes for a basic gene alignment with <100 sequences.\nSelect the box on the left hand side of your analysis and click the DOWNLOAD SELECTED JOBS at the bottom.\nYou can now open the trees for editing in your fave program - mine is FigTree.\nOpen the file ending in .contree to get the concensus tree. This will have the bootstrap supports (%) at the nodes.\nIf you open the .treefile you will find the support nodes for the SH-aLRT support (%) / aBayes support / ultrafast bootstrap support (%).\nDetails on the analysis including the results from the model selection, parameters, and citations can be found in the .log and .iqtree files [open these files using a simple text reader such as TextEdit for MacOS or similar].\nExample of output from the .iqtree file showing that after model selection the phylogeny was based on the TIM + F + I + G4 subsitution model. Remember for more details on these model check out details here\n\n\n\nIQ-TREE log"

On most versions of Linux, it is accessible by running the (Gnome) Terminal or (KDE) Konsole or xterm, which can be found via the applications menu or the search bar. If your machine is set up to use something other than Bash, you can run it by opening a terminal and typing bash.\nmacOS\nFor a Mac computer running macOS Mojave or earlier releases, the default Unix Shell is Bash. For a Mac computer running macOS Catalina or later releases, the default Unix Shell is Zsh. Your default shell is available via the Terminal program within your Utilities folder.\nTo open Terminal, try one or both of the following:\n\nIn Finder, select the Go menu, then select Utilities. Locate Terminal in the Utilities folder and open it.\nUse the Mac ‚ÄòSpotlight‚Äô computer search function. Search for: Terminal and press Return.\n\nTo check if your machine is set up to use something other than Bash, type echo $SHELL in your terminal window.\nIf your machine is set up to use something other than Bash, you can run it by opening a terminal and typing bash.\nReference: How to Use Terminal on a Mac\nWindows\nComputers with Windows operating systems do not automatically have a Unix Shell program installed. In this lesson, we encourage you to use an emulator included in Git for Windows, which gives you access to both Bash shell commands and Git. If you are attending a Software Carpentry workshop session, it is likely you have already received instructions on how to install Git for Windows.\nOnce installed, you can open a terminal by running the program Git Bash from the Windows start menu.\nOther solutions are available for running Bash commands on Windows. There is now a Bash shell command-line tool available for Windows 10. Additionally, you can run Bash commands on a remote computer or server that already has a Unix Shell, from your Windows machine. This can usually be done through a Secure Shell (SSH) client. One such client available for free for Windows computers is PuTTY. See the reference below for information on installing and using PuTTY, using the Windows 10 command-line tool, or installing and using a Unix/Linux emulator.\nReference: Git for Windows - Recommended\nFor advanced users, you may choose one of the following alternatives1:1¬†Please note that commands in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Cygwin may differ slightly from those shown in the lesson or presented in the workshop.\n\nInstall the Windows Subsystem for Linux\nUsing a Unix/Linux emulator (Cygwin) or Secure Shell (SSH) client (Putty)"

    "text": "Preprints\nIn academic publishing, a preprint is a version of a scholarly or scientific paper that precedes formal peer review and publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly or scientific journal. The preprint may be available, often as a non-typeset version available free, before and/or after a paper is published in a journal.\nPublishing is a costly exercise that you don‚Äôt think about until after you‚Äôve got your funding and data and written the paper, but it is arguably the most important part of research‚Ä¶what good is your data if you cannot share it?\nEspecially for PhD students you will often have to publish in access only journals - these journals are free to publish in but only those with a subscription can view it. These days most journals will allow you to submit a pre-print of your work to a server, this is a great option as it means you still get the beautiful published article but can also share the ‚Äònot-so-pretty‚Äô version as well. However this ruling is not universal among journal so make sure you check the journal requirements before submitting a preprint!\nPreprint servers will assign your article a DOI, meaning you can easily reference your work while it is going through the peer review process. Once published the DOI will usually transfer automatically to the published version. You may find that for some of the academic/publication databases you will have to manually ‚Äòmerge‚Äô the preprint and published entries.\nFor more info on preprints see here and here. An excellent article by Sarabipour et al.¬†2019 will be useful to help convince your co-authors on the value of submitting to a preprint server!\nSome pre-print servers include:\n\nbioRxiv - preprint server for biology\nmedRxiv - prerint server for health sciences\narXiv - preprint server for physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.\nResearch Square - Research Square is a leading author, editorial, and video services provider. We are a trusted partner to many of the leading academic publishers, institutions, and societies worldwide."

(yes/no). Otherwise, keep adding generations until the value falls below 0.01. If you are interested mainly in the well-supported parts of the tree, a standard deviation below 0.05 may be adequate.\nType sump to summarize the parameter values using the same burn-in as the diagnostics in the mcmc command. The program will output a table with summaries of the samples of the substitution model parameters, including the mean, mode, and 95 % credibility interval (region of Highest Posterior Density, HPD) of each parameter. Make sure that the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) is reasonably close to 1.0 for all parameters; if not, you need to run the analysis longer.\nSummarize the trees using the same burn-in as the mcmc command by typing sumt. The program will output a cladogram with the posterior probabilities for each split (file ending .trprobs) and a phylogram with mean branch lengths (file ending .con.tre). Both trees will also be printed to a file that can be read by FigTree and other tree-drawing programs, such as TreeView and Mesquite.\nIt does not have to be more complicated than this; however, as you get more proficient you will probably want to know more about what is happening behind the scenes.

As such I have switched to the ENA for submission of sequence data.\nThis documentation is works for me and is not extensive, it is meant to be a streamlined version of the information contained within the extensive information available at ENA: Guidelines and Tutorials.\nFor submitting data there are a number of options and this is written from a mac user.\nSee submission page here\nI use a combination of the following options:\n\n‚ÄòSubmit to ENA Interactively‚Äô - Submit to ENA with Webin Interactive\n‚ÄòWebin Submission Portal‚Äô - Monitor progress of your submissions to eNA\n\n\n1. Register project\nGo to the Webin interface - i.e.¬†select the ‚ÄòSubmit to ENA Interactively‚Äô(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home) option from the submission home page.\nUnder the New submission tab select Register study (Project) [Register your Study to begin data submission to ENA], and press next\nEnter your study details - not you do not need to include Tags or a PudMed Id at this stage.\n\nSelect submit.\nOnce it has completed you should get an email which will include a project/study accession number e.g.¬†PRJXXXXXX. It will also now appears under the Studies tab in the Webin interface.\n\n\n2. Register samples\nUnder the New submission tab select Register samples [Register Samples to give context to your data], and press next\nTo begin with use the Start building your submission option to generate a sample sheet. Select the Select Checklist option open more details.\n\nIf you are unsure on which option is right for your generally for a lot of metabarcoding studies (e.g.¬†bacteria 16S microbiome, 18S eukaryote etc) related to some ‚Äúhost‚Äù (either vertebrate or invertebrate) then choose the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGSC MIxS host associated\nGenomic Standards Consortium package extension for reporting of measurements and observations obtained from the environment where the sample was obtained. By choosing the environmental package, a selection of fields can be made from a relevant subsets of the GSC terms.\n\n\nSelect the checklist and press next.\nYou can then customise and add in additional fields\n\nSelect the download template option and then complete the spreadsheet. The downloaded file with have a name like: data-2362730139549190230.tsv. When you open the file it will have a header similar to the following:\n#checklist_accession\n#unique_name_prefix\n#sample_alias\n#template\n#units\nYou start entering your sample information on line 6, and some notes on headers for the GSC MIxS host associated option:\n\nsample_alias - your sequence ID\ntax_id - You can find your taxonomy ID from the NCBI taxonomy database\nscientific_name - Your scientific name must be at the species level. Tips for working with environmental samples are here\ncommon_name - Free text\nsample_title - Free text\nsample_description - Free text\nproject name - Free text, I use the project name I entered in the corresponding project registration\nsequencing method -\ninvestigation type - e.g.¬†mimarks-survey\ncollection date - acceptable formats include YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY\ngeographic location (country and/or sea) - Must match the country names as they appear in the ENA data base. e.g.¬†‚ÄúAustralia‚Äù\ngeographic location (latitude) - DD format e.g.¬†-33.69\ngeographic location (longitude) - DD format e.g.¬†151.25\nhost-associated environmental package - e.g.¬†host-associated\nenvironment (biome) - Australian biomes\nenvironment (feature) - e.g.¬†animal-associated habitat\nenvironment (material) - free text e.g.¬†Blood\n\nYou will then have to use to Previous button to navigate back to the stage where you can upload the sample sheet.\n\nfile extension must be .tsv ot .txt\n\n\n\n3. Upload sequence files\nI have the easiest and quickest way to do this for large data is to to use the command line.\nDetails on Uploading Files Using Command Line FTP Client\nBut put simply:\n\nOpen the terminal and navigate to the directory where the raw sequence files are.\nType lftp webin2.ebi.ac.uk -u Webin-xxxxx, filling in your Webin username and enter your Webin password when prompted. Type ls command to check the content of your directory (check your in the correct directory)\nUse mput <filename> command to upload files. For bulk upload of zipped fastq files (i.e.¬†ending in .fastq.gz) simply type mput *.fastq.gz\nOnce it has complete use bye command to exit the ftp client.\n\n\n\n4. Run analysis\nThis will link your uploaded sequence files to their corresponding sample and project identifiers.\nYou must already have completed the following:\n\nRegister Project\nRegister Samples\nUpload the raw sequence files\n\nFrom the Webin submission page under the New Submission tab select Submit sequence reads and experiments [We recommend that Fastq, BAM, and CRAM read files are submitted using Webin-CLI]. Press next.\nSelect the project which you want to associate the run/experiment to. Note you can only select one project at a time.\nIt will then prompt you for sample information. However hopefully you have alreayd done this so select the Skip option in the bottom right hand corner.\nSelect your sequence file format e.g.¬†CRAM, BAM, One Fastq file, Two Fastq files etc.\nThen select the Download Spreadsheet option and complete the file with some tips below. The downloaded file with have a name like: experiment_paired_fastq_spreadsheet.tsv\nThen Upload Completed Spreadsheet and once it has checked for errors, press the Submit button.\n\nNotes for the experiment spreadsheet\nmd5 generation\nTo generate the md5 file you can use terminal and simple execute:\nmd5 <file-name>\nFor bulk execution you can use:\nmd5 *.fastq.gz which will generate something like this:\nmd5 example.fastq.gz\n90fb727a1889a9e2194d838514beef19\nSpreadsheet headers\nSome tips here aimed at generation of paired-end sequence data:\n\nproject_accession - this comes from when you first registered the project e.g.¬†PRJXXXXX\nproject_alias - you can leave this blank\nexperiment_alias - a sequential ID for each sample e.g.¬†for first sample ena-EXPERIMENT-INSTITUTION-DD-MM-YYYY-HH:MM:SS:XXX-1\nrun_alias - a sequential ID for each sample e.g.¬†for first sample ena-RUN-INSTITUTION-DD-MM-YYYY-HH:MM:SS:XXX-1\nlibrary_name - your identifier for library name\nlibrary_source - e.g.¬†GENOMIC\nlibrary_selection - e.g.¬†PCR\nlibrary_strategy - e.g.¬†AMPLICON\ndesign_description - brief description of library\nlibrary_construction_protocol - brief description of library construction such as kit e.g.¬†Nextera XT DNA\ninstrument_model - e.g.¬†Illumina MiSeq\nfile_type e.g.¬†fastq\nlibrary_layout SINGLE OR PAIRED\ninsert_size - numbers only in basepairs or nucleotide e.g.¬†for 300 bp = 300\nforward_file_name - sample-id-R1.fastq.gz\nforward_file_md5 - e.g.¬†90fb727a1889a9e2194d838514beef19\nforward_file_unencrypted_md5 - can leave blank\nreverse_file_name - sample-id-R2.fastq.gz\nreverse_file_md5 - e.g.¬†90fb727a1889a9e2194d838514beef19\nreverse_file_unencrypted_md5 - can leave blank\n\n\nfile extension must be .tsv or .csv"

Below are just two on the most useful ones that I like (I tend to like the command line interface ones, as they can easily be upscaled and used on your VM/supercomputer if needed).\nContents\n\nSome simple commands\nSeqmagick\nSeqKit\nBioawk\n\n\nBasic information and links\nThis section first starts off with some quick useful commands that will be helpful to assess and manipulate your fasta and fastq file.

    "text": "I am an early career researcher at Murdoch University, Western Australia. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow within the Centre for Computational and Systems Medicine. This research is focused on understanding the interactions at the host-microbe axis using a range of omic technologies. My recent PhD research was focused on ticks (Ixodida) and associated vector-borne microbes (bacteria and protozoa) in Australian wildlife\nI am currently working on a project in conjunction with the Australian National Phenome Centre titled Understanding host-microbiome signalling axes in ageing under the direction of Prof.¬†Elaine Holmes. The research aims to deepen the understanding of host-microbiome signalling in ageing by: (i) bringing together next generation sequencing technologies to characterise age-associated change in gut bacterial composition, (ii) metabolic profiling to identify changes in functionality of the ageing microbiome, and (iii) a combination of in vitro and in vivo screening approaches to establish molecular mechanisms. The new knowledge will facilitate development of improved models of health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI recently completed by PhD thesis titled Ecology of ticks and microbes in Australian wildlife and a copy can be found here. This was part of an ARC linkage grant (Tiresome ticks: Ecology and transmission of tick-borne disease in Australia, LP160100200) by the Vector and Waterborne Pathogens Research Group at Murdoch University. It aimed to identify and characterise the microbial biodiversity in ticks and wildlife reservoir hosts, providing important insights into potential causative agent(s) of zoonotic tick-borne pathogens.\nI started my PhD in 2018 under the supervision of Dr.¬†Charlotte Oksam, Prof.¬†Peter Irwin, Prof.¬†Una Ryan and Prof.¬†Peter Banks (University of Sydney). This research uncovered new information relating to the microbes present in both ticks and wildlife, and will be of value for the on-going effort to identify causative agent(s) of tick-borne illnesses in Australia.\n\n\n\nIn 2017 I undertook an honours research project in Molecular Biology (first class). My thesis was titled ‚ÄòProfiling the bacterial microbiome of ticks that parasitise bandicoots in Australia‚Äô, under the supervision of Dr.¬†Charlotte Oksam and Prof.¬†Peter Irwin, and is available for download here. During my project I identified a number of recently described and novel candidate tick-borne pathogens in ticks parasitsing bandicoots (Order: Peramelemorphia). After finishing my honours research I undertook a paid summer internship with Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in November 2017, diving into all things coding and bioinformatics.\nI completed a Bachelor of Science in Animal Health and Wildlife & Conservation Biology (2014‚Äì2016). During my undergraduate studies I developed a strong passion for wildlife health which evolved into my fascination with the interconnection of the health of the environment, animals and people. I spent time volunteering on a number of projects, and was heavily involved as a volunteer field and lab assistant into the woylie decline as part of Dr.¬†Amy Northover‚Äôs PhD. My interests expand to other areas of wildlife conservation, including the completion of an independent project on camera trapping of small mammals in Dryandra woodlands under the supervision of A/Prof Peter Spencer (Murdoch University) and Mark Cowan (Parks and Wildlife, Western Australia)."
