## Welcome!

I am an early career researcher at Murdoch University, Western Australia. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow within the [Centre for Computational and Systems Medicine](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/research/hfi/our-centres/centre-for-computational-and-systems-medicine). This research is focused on understanding the interactions at the host-microbe axis using a range of omic technologies. My recent PhD research was focused on ticks (Ixodida) and associated vector-borne microbes (bacteria and protozoa) in Australian wildlife

I am currently working on a project in conjunction with the [Australian National Phenome Centre](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/research/anpc) titled [*Understanding host-microbiome signalling axes in ageing*](https://www.arc.gov.au/news-publications/media/funding-announcement-kits/australian-laureate-fellowships-2020/2020-laureate-profile-professor-elaine-holmes) under the direction of [Prof. Elaine Holmes](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elaine-Holmes). The research aims to deepen the understanding of host-microbiome signalling in ageing by: (i) bringing together next generation sequencing technologies to characterise age-associated change in gut bacterial composition, (ii) metabolic profiling to identify changes in functionality of the ageing microbiome, and (iii) a combination of in vitro and in vivo screening approaches to establish molecular mechanisms. The new knowledge will facilitate development of improved models of health care.

I recently completed by PhD thesis titled *Ecology of ticks and microbes in Australian wildlife* and a copy can be found [here](https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/65255/). 
This was part of an ARC linkage grant (*Tiresome ticks: Ecology and transmission of tick-borne disease in Australia*, LP160100200) by the [Vector and Waterborne Pathogens Research Group](http://www.murdoch.edu.au/Research-capabilities/Vector-and-Waterborne-Pathogens-Group/Meet-the-Team/) at Murdoch University. 
It aimed to identify and characterise the microbial biodiversity in ticks and wildlife reservoir hosts, providing important insights into potential causative agent(s) of zoonotic tick-borne pathogens.  
I started my PhD in 2018 under the supervision of [Dr. Charlotte Oksam](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/charlotte-oskam/), [Prof. Peter Irwin](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/peter-irwin/), [Prof. Una Ryan](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/una-ryan/) and [Prof. Peter Banks](http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/peter.banks.php) (University of Sydney).  This research uncovered new information relating to the microbes present in both ticks and wildlife, and will be of value for the on-going effort to identify causative agent(s) of tick-borne illnesses in Australia.

In 2017 I undertook an honours research project in Molecular Biology (first class). My thesis was titled 'Profiling the bacterial microbiome of ticks that parasitise bandicoots in Australia', under the supervision of [Dr. Charlotte Oksam](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/charlotte-oskam/) and [Prof. Peter Irwin,](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/peter-irwin/) and is available for download [here](http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/40003/). During my project I identified a number of recently described and novel candidate tick-borne pathogens in ticks parasitsing bandicoots (Order: Peramelemorphia). After finishing my honours research I undertook a paid summer internship with [Pawsey Supercomputing Centre](https://www.pawsey.org.au/) in November 2017, diving into all things coding and bioinformatics.

I completed a Bachelor of Science in Animal Health and Wildlife & Conservation Biology (2014--2016). During my undergraduate studies I developed a strong passion for wildlife health which evolved into my fascination with the interconnection of the health of the environment, animals and people. I spent time volunteering on a number of projects, and was heavily involved as a volunteer field and lab assistant into the woylie decline as part of [Dr. Amy Northover's](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amy_Northover) PhD. My interests expand to other areas of wildlife conservation, including the completion of an independent project on camera trapping of small mammals in Dryandra woodlands under the supervision of [A/Prof Peter Spencer](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/peter-spencer/) (Murdoch University) and [Mark Cowan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Cowan5) (Parks and Wildlife, Western Australia).
