After a year of crickets, I have re-invigorated my academic website.

Making use of the newly announced [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) language, I am building this website to merge my separate [research site](https://siobhonlegan.com/research_site/) and consolidate my research related content on the web!

I have now structured the separate webpages on my [research site](https://siobhonlegan.com/research_site/) as blog posts.

You can use the *Categories* option on the right-hand to see related posts.
