It also has a an extensive list of extra resources and useful links to reading material\n* [RevBayes](https://github.com/revbayes) github page has a wealth of information specifically around the software but also includes some general phylogenetics material as well. Tutorial pages available [here](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/), a example of workshop page on molecular phylogenetics and fossil data available [here](http://phyloworks.org/revbayes-workshop2017/)\n* [Taming the BEAST](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Introduction-to-BEAST2/) workshops around the use of BEAST software for Phylogenetics\n* [Bayesian MCMC phylogenetics tutorial in R](https://github.com/thednainus/Bayesian_tutorial) - for those wanting an R interface for their Phylogenetics\n* [Collection of tutorials on phylogenetics](https://github.com/mmatschiner/tutorials) by Michael Matschiner. This goes through the workflow from sequence analysis through to dating and more\n* [Data Integration, Manipulation and Visualization of Phylogenetic Trees](https://yulab-smu.github.io/treedata-book/index.html)\n\nBroadly conducting a phylogenetic analysis can be broken down in the following steps:\n\n1. Obtain sequences (e.g. your own sequences - ensure you perform approriate QC methods, or reference sequences from Genbank etc)\n    - [NCBI Genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)\n    - [NCBI Genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/)\n    - [NCBI Protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/)\n2. Align sequences\n    - [MUSCLE, Edgar](https://drive5.com/muscle/)\n    - [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)\n    - [Clustal](http://www.clustal.org/)\n3. Decide on appropriate method and model - this will differ depending on your study question, data available, gene(s), length of sequence, type of data (i.e. nucleotide, amino acid etc)\n    - You will likely need to use some program to help you decide on most appropriate model\n4. Conduct phylogeny recontsruction (with or without bootstrap/node support)\n5. Visualize and edit tree\n    - [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)\n    - [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/) - free open source graphics editor\n    - Mre tree views [here](http://www.treedyn.org/overview/editors.html)\n",
