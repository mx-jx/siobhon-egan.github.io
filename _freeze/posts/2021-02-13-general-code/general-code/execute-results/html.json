It provides a communal notepad that everyone can access - provide a single link and you can drop in any information, bits of code, webpage links, resources etc in this central place rather than having people rely on copying code correctly from a screen.\n\n* [etherpad wikimedia](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/)\n* [pad carpentries](https://pad.carpentries.org/)\n* [pad riseup](https://pad.riseup.net/)\n* [pad carpentries](https://pad.carpentries.org/)\n\n",
