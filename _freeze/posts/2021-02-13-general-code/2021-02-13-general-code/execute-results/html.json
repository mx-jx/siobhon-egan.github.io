While you most systems come with a basic built-in editor (e.g. `TextEdit` for MacOS or `notepad` for windows) its best to find one you like early one.\n\nMy favourite is [atom](https://atom.io/) - which is **FREE**.\n\nOthers include:\n\n-   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - **PAID**\n-   [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)\n-   [TextMate](https://macromates.com/)\n\n## Etherpad\n\nAn etherpad is an excellent tool to use for teaching and workshops. It provides a communal notepad that everyone can access - provide a single link and you can drop in any information, bits of code, webpage links, resources etc in this central place rather than having people rely on copying code correctly from a screen.\n\n-   [etherpad wikimedia](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/)\n-   [pad carpentries](https://pad.carpentries.org/)\n-   [pad riseup](https://pad.riseup.net/)\n-   [pad carpentries](https://pad.carpentries.org/)\n",
